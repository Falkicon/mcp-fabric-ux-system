# Coding Standards

## General
- Follow standard conventions for the language being used (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, standard JavaScript style guides).
- Prioritize code clarity and readability. Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions and methods concise and focused on a single responsibility.
- Add comments only for complex logic or non-obvious sections; avoid commenting obvious code.

## Language Specific (Examples - Expand as needed)

### Python
- Linter: Use Flake8 / Ruff with standard configurations.
- Formatter: Use Black / Ruff formatter.
- Type Hinting: Use standard type hints for function signatures and complex variables.

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Linter: Use ESLint with [Specify Configuration, e.g., Airbnb, StandardJS].
- Formatter: Use Prettier with default settings.
- Use `const` by default; use `let` only when reassignment is necessary.
- Prefer modern JavaScript features (arrow functions, template literals, async/await).
- TypeScript: Leverage strong typing; avoid `any` where possible.

### HTML/CSS
- Use semantic HTML5 elements.
- Follow BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) or a similar methodology for CSS class naming.
- Keep CSS selectors specific but avoid excessive nesting.

## Performance
- Be mindful of algorithmic complexity (Big O notation).
- Avoid unnecessary computations within loops.
- Profile performance-critical sections when necessary.

## Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks, proper error propagation).
- Provide informative error messages.

## Dependency Management
- Verify the necessity of new dependencies before adding them. Check for existing functionality.
- When requested, assist in analyzing project metadata files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) for context.
- Document significant dependency changes.

## Code Formatting & Cleanup
- When creating files to debug issues, be sure to comment that they are temporary at the top of the file and delete them when the debugging is complete.
- Apply configured code formatters (e.g., Black, Prettier) consistently.
- Utilize linters (e.g., Ruff, Flake8, ESLint) to identify potential issues.
- When requested, assist in generating commands or performing actions to remove unused code, imports, or files (requires human verification before execution).

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or error messages.
- Follow standard security practices for the framework/platform being used. 

## Testing
- When tests are failing and there is not a clear solution, consider adding more logs to help debug the issue.
- If adding more logs don't help to figure out why a test is failing, consider taking a look at the big picture, re-review the code files, and consider a different approach.
- If a different approach does not solve the problem, consider doing a web search or asking the user to provide research on a specific topic.
