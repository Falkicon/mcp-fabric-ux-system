```

#### Research and Planning

Before starting design work, research and planning are essential:

1. **Understand user needs**: Conduct user research to understand the needs, goals, and pain points of your users
2. **Define requirements**: Define the functional and non-functional requirements for your design
3. **Identify patterns**: Identify existing patterns in the Fabric UX System that can address your requirements
4. **Plan your approach**: Develop a plan for your design work, including timelines and deliverables

#### Design and Iteration

During the design phase, focus on creating designs that align with the Fabric UX System:

1. **Use the Figma UI kit**: Start with components and patterns from the Figma UI kit
2. **Apply design tokens**: Use design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements
3. **Follow guidelines**: Follow the guidelines and best practices in the Fabric UX System
4. **Iterate based on feedback**: Gather feedback from stakeholders and users, and iterate on your designs

#### Handoff to Development

When handing off designs to developers, provide clear documentation and guidance:

1. **Document design decisions**: Document the rationale behind your design decisions
2. **Specify design tokens**: Clearly specify the design tokens used in your designs
3. **Provide interaction details**: Document interaction details, such as hover states and animations
4. **Collaborate with developers**: Work closely with developers to ensure your designs are implemented correctly

##### Design-to-Code Component Alignment

A key advantage of the Fabric UX System is the precise one-to-one alignment between Figma design components and their code implementations. This alignment streamlines the handoff process in several ways:

- **Consistent component properties**: Component properties, variants, and states share the same naming conventions in both Figma and code, creating a common language between designers and developers.

- **Identical visual rendering**: Code components are engineered to render exactly as they appear in Figma, eliminating the need for pixel-perfect adjustments during implementation.

- **Automatic token mapping**: Design tokens used in Figma components map directly to the same tokens in code components, ensuring visual consistency across platforms.

- **Reduced implementation questions**: The tight alignment reduces ambiguity and the number of clarification questions during development, accelerating the implementation process.

- **Simplified design updates**: When designs change, the shared component structure makes it easier to identify and implement the necessary code changes.

This alignment significantly reduces the traditional friction in the design-to-development handoff process, allowing teams to focus on solving user problems rather than debating implementation details.

### Design Best Practices

Follow these best practices to create effective designs with the Fabric UX System:

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with the Fabric UX System and within your application
- **Accessibility**: Design with accessibility in mind, following WCAG 2.2 guidelines
- **Simplicity**: Keep designs simple and focused on user needs
- **Flexibility**: Design for different screen sizes, devices, and user preferences
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications in your designs

## Getting Started for Developers

Developers implement the Fabric UX System, bringing designs to life through code. This section provides guidance for developers on getting started with the system.

### Development Environment Setup

To set up your development environment for the Fabric UX System:

1. **Install Node.js**: The Fabric UX System requires Node.js version 14 or later
2. **Install npm**: npm is used to install and manage packages
3. **Set up your project**: Create a new project or set up an existing project to use the Fabric UX System
4. **Install dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies for your framework (React, Angular, or other)

### Component Libraries

The Fabric UX System provides component libraries for different frameworks:

#### React Components

For React applications, install the Fabric UX System React components:

```bash
npm install @fabric-msft/react
```

Then import and use the components in your React application:

```jsx
import { Button, TextField } from '@fabric-msft/react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TextField label="Name" />
      <Button appearance="primary">Submit</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Angular Components

For Angular applications, install the Fabric UX System Angular components:

```bash
npm install @fabric-msft/angular
```

Then import the modules in your Angular application:

```typescript
import { FabricButtonModule, FabricTextFieldModule } from '@fabric-msft/angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    FabricButtonModule,
    FabricTextFieldModule
  ],
  // ...
})
export class MyModule { }
```

And use the components in your templates:

```html
<fabric-text-field label="Name"></fabric-text-field>
<fabric-button appearance="primary">Submit</fabric-button>
```

#### Web Components

For applications using other frameworks or no framework, install the Fabric UX System Web Components:

```bash
npm install @fabric-msft/web-components
```

Then import and use the components in your application:

```html
<script type="module">
  import '@fabric-msft/web-components';
</script>

<fabric-text-field label="Name"></fabric-text-field>
<fabric-button appearance="primary">Submit</fabric-button>
```

### Styling Approaches

The Fabric UX System supports different styling approaches:

#### CSS Custom Properties

CSS custom properties (variables) are used to implement design tokens in the Fabric UX System. You can use these variables in your own styles:

```css
.my-element {
  color: var(--colorNeutralForeground1);
  background-color: var(--colorNeutralBackground1);
  padding: var(--spacingHorizontalM) var(--spacingHorizontalL);
}
```

#### CSS Modules

CSS Modules can be used with the Fabric UX System to create scoped styles:

```css
/* MyComponent.module.css */
.container {
  display: flex;
  gap: var(--spacingHorizontalM);
}
```

```jsx
import styles from './MyComponent.module.css';
import { Button } from '@fabric-msft/react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Button appearance="primary">Submit</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Styled Components

Styled Components can be used with the Fabric UX System in React applications:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { Button } from '@fabric-msft/react';

const Container = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  gap: var(--spacingHorizontalM);
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <Button appearance="primary">Submit</Button>
    </Container>
  );
}
```

#### Understanding Shadow DOM and Component Styling

The Fabric UX System uses Web Components with shadow DOM, which affects how you style and customize components:

##### Shadow DOM Encapsulation

The shadow DOM encapsulates component internals so that CSS rules from the document (or "light DOM") won't directly affect elements inside the shadow tree. This prevents style conflicts but allows for controlled customization through several mechanisms:

1. **Inherited properties**: CSS properties like color, font-family, and font-size are inherited from the parent element into the shadow DOM. This allows for basic theming of components.

2. **CSS custom properties**: CSS variables are inherited and can be used inside the shadow DOM, letting you "theme" components externally:

   ```css
   fabric-button {
     --button-background: #0078d4;
   }
   ```

3. **Exposed styling APIs**: Components expose specific parts of their shadow DOM for styling using the `::part()` and `::slotted()` pseudo-elements:

   ```css
   /* Style the button's label part */
   fabric-button::part(label) {
     font-weight: bold;
   }
   
   /* Style elements slotted into the component */
   fabric-button::slotted(span) {
     color: red;
   }
   ```

This approach provides the right balance of encapsulation and customization, allowing you to theme components appropriately without risking style conflicts with other parts of your application.

```

### Assessment and Planning

Before integrating the Fabric UX System, assess your existing codebase and plan your approach:

1. **Audit your current UI**: Identify the components, patterns, and styles in your current UI
2. **Identify gaps**: Identify gaps between your current UI and the Fabric UX System
3. **Prioritize components**: Prioritize which components to migrate first
4. **Develop a migration plan**: Create a plan for migrating to the Fabric UX System

### Incremental Adoption

Adopt the Fabric UX System incrementally to minimize disruption:

1. **Start with design tokens**: Implement design tokens first to establish a consistent visual language
2. **Migrate common components**: Migrate common components like buttons, inputs, and navigation elements
3. **Implement patterns**: Implement shared UX patterns for common user tasks
4. **Refine and iterate**: Continuously refine and iterate on your implementation

### Coexistence with Existing Libraries

During the migration process, the Fabric UX System can coexist with existing UI libraries without conflicts:

#### Peer Dependencies

Fluent UI Web Components used in the Fabric UX System have no shared dependencies with Fluent UI React. This means you can use both libraries in the same application without worrying about version conflicts or dependency issues.

#### Theme Interoperability

The Fabric UX System supports theme interoperability with existing Fabric components. It uses the same design tokens as Fluent UI React v9 and other existing Fabric tokens, ensuring visual consistency across components from different libraries.

#### CSS Isolation

Web Components utilize shadow DOM, preventing style conflicts or CSS leakage between Fabric UX System components and your existing components. This isolation makes it safe to introduce Fabric UX System components into existing applications without worrying about CSS conflicts.

### Adoption Guidance

When adopting the Fabric UX System, consider the following guidance:

1. **Gradual adoption**: Components support gradual adoption alongside existing React and Angular components.
2. **Phasing out legacy libraries**: Reducing legacy UI library debt by identifying opportunities for component replacement is recommended and can be prioritized to aid transitions.
3. **Mixing components**: Developers are encouraged to mix Web Components with existing components as needed. For example, you can use Fabric UX System buttons within an existing Angular form.

### Coexistence Strategies

During the migration process, your existing UI and the Fabric UX System will coexist. Use these strategies to manage the coexistence:

1. **Consistent theming**: Ensure that your existing UI and the Fabric UX System share a consistent theme
2. **Wrapper components**: Create wrapper components to provide a consistent API for both existing and new components
3. **Feature flags**: Use feature flags to gradually roll out new components
4. **Documentation**: Document which components are from the Fabric UX System and which are from your existing UI

### Migration Patterns

Use these patterns to migrate from your existing UI to the Fabric UX System:

#### Strangler Pattern

The strangler pattern involves gradually replacing parts of your application with new implementations:

1. Identify a component or pattern to migrate
2. Implement the new version using the Fabric UX System
3. Replace the old implementation with the new one
4. Repeat for other components and patterns

#### Parallel Implementation

Parallel implementation involves creating a new version of your application alongside the existing one:

1. Create a new version of your application using the Fabric UX System
2. Run both versions in parallel
3. Gradually migrate users to the new version
4. Retire the old version when migration is complete

#### Hybrid Approach

A hybrid approach combines elements of both the strangler pattern and parallel implementation:

1. Identify components and patterns to migrate
2. Implement new versions using the Fabric UX System
3. Create a new version of your application that uses both existing and new components
4. Gradually replace remaining components with Fabric UX System components

### Cross-Extension/App Synchronization

One advantage of Web Components is that they are fully encapsulated in shadow DOM, preventing version conflicts even if different versions coexist in different extensions. This means you don't need synchronization between extensions or apps regarding shared components published by the Fabric shell.

Different parts of your application can use different versions of the same component without conflicts, allowing for more flexible and gradual updates.

### Framework Upgrade Benefits

The Fabric UX System provides significant advantages when upgrading to newer versions of frameworks like React or Angular:

#### Simplified Framework Migrations

When upgrading to new major versions of frameworks (e.g., React 18 to 19 or Angular 16 to 17), applications using Fabric UX System components experience fewer breaking changes and require less refactoring:

- **Component stability**: The core functionality of Fabric UX components is implemented in framework-agnostic Web Components, making them immune to breaking changes in framework updates.

- **Minimal wrapper updates**: Only the thin wrapper layer needs updates during framework upgrades, which is a much smaller effort than refactoring traditional framework-specific components.

- **Reduced testing burden**: Less regression testing is needed after framework upgrades since the core component behavior remains unchanged.

#### Technical Debt Reduction

Using Fabric UX System components helps reduce technical debt related to framework dependencies:

- **Future-proofing**: Your UI components are built on web standards that evolve more slowly and predictably than JavaScript frameworks.

- **Smaller update surface**: The wrapper layer has a smaller API surface than traditional framework-specific components and is largely automated, making updates simpler.

- **Consistent behavior**: Your application's UI remains stable during framework transitions because the underlying Web Components continue to function consistently.

This architecture significantly reduces the maintenance burden typically associated with keeping applications current with the latest framework versions, allowing teams to adopt new framework features and security updates with less risk and effort.

## Versioning and Updates

Managing versions and updates is an important aspect of implementing the Fabric UX System in your applications.

### Breaking Changes Management

Breaking changes during the beta phase will be minimal and follow semantic versioning. APIs align with design specifications and Fluent React v9. After the official 1.0 release, strict semantic versioning will apply. 

Product teams can manage the impact by locking package versions, with changes communicated clearly in advance. This approach allows teams to update on their own schedule while ensuring they have the information they need to plan for updates.

### Version Update Responsibilities

Product teams will manage updates themselves by specifying newer package versions to maintain control over their release cadence. Clear communication about updates will be provided by the Fabric UX System team, including:

- Release notes detailing changes
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Deprecation notices for features that will be removed in future versions

### Validation and Rollout Strategies

Validation before adoption is best performed by incorporating components into features and providing feedback. Post-update validation will rely on each product's testing strategy. Fabric UX System components undergo rigorous testing internally to minimize risk.

When planning a rollout of updated components:

1. Test the new version in a development environment
2. Validate the update with your specific use cases
3. Plan a phased rollout to minimize risk
4. Monitor for issues during the rollout
5. Have a rollback plan in case of unexpected issues

### Cross-Extension/App Synchronization

One advantage of Web Components is that they are fully encapsulated in shadow DOM, preventing version conflicts even if different versions coexist in different extensions. This means you don't need synchronization between extensions or apps regarding shared components published by the Fabric shell.

Different parts of your application can use different versions of the same component without conflicts, allowing for more flexible and gradual updates.
